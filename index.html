    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
        Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all, I would strongly suggest that they would use a thirdparty application. This would help out running the site more continuesly.
                                The help of a third party also includes that you trust the thirdparty and that the thirdparty app is always updating and protecting against
                                new threaths. 
                                I would also recomend using a CI/CD for a secure way to add more or new code. This would help out to secure that the code is correct added 
                                with the correct input. There will also be a security check for everyone time code is added or changed for help you to find out if there is 
                                something wrong and this will allert you if there is something wrong.
                                There are also more programs and security meassures to be added if you want, like an log in authentication for users, if you perhaps are making
                                a shop there is a lot of private information to be added from a potensial check out page and the name, adress, contact information, credit card
                                information and so on, that is crusual to secure for others so they can't use this information further.
                                I would keep a full code of a website somewhere local that always updated when changes where made. This is if the code will crash or be hacked that
                                you could restore the page in a new domain and transfer all the secure data over to this new one. I would also want to have the ability to shut down
                                original site instantaneously for no further damage.
